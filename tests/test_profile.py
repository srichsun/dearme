"""Rolling-read tests.

The condense step is an LLM call, so it's mocked — what's checked here is the
wiring: that one person's own days are the raw material, that the previous
reading is carried forward, that the energy ratings go in alongside the
writing, and that nothing rebuilds it unless asked.
