    Kept as four named sections rather than one blob of prose, because the
    screen shows them as four separate things and the coach leans on them
    differently. Rebuilt only when the person asks for it — nothing here
    updates on its own.

    Keyed by the person's Firebase uid. Bounded on purpose: it is injected into
    every conversation, so it must not grow without end.
